# MA-Data
Code for MA Thesis

When I ran this code, all the data (the excel and CSV files) was in one folder called MA_Data. All the scripts to process the data were collected with the analysis file into the R project. 

When running the analysis, as long as the data and the scripts are in the same project folder, it will automatically crunch the numbers to calculate the correlations and produce the graphs into an output folder named 'plot results'
